Part I: Read Code Written by another Coder:



PART 1:

The function one() is one of Python's built-in functions. It returns the length of an object. For example, it can return the number of items in a list.


Generate a random string of any length in Python. create a random password with lower case upper case letters digits ...



PART2:


also def function_two() is the same as the function one()  




organize files in the given directory based on their names.



the function organizes files in the given directory on the date in their filenames

PART3:

is_w(date): checks if the given date is a weekend day  and returns a Boolean value accordingly.

is_h(date): this function checks if the given date is a holiday 

generater(start_date, end_date):this fanction generates a dictionary of dates for each year between the start date and end date

def main() function is defined to call the generater() function with the start and end dates

the main() function is executed using asyncio's run() method.

Overall, the code uses asyncio to efficiently generate a list of workdays for the year 2023 by excluding weekends and holidays.
